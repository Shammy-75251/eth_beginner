## **Overview**
The MyToken smart contract is a simple implementation of an ERC-20-like token using Solidity. This contract showcases basic functionalities such as minting and burning tokens, making it ideal for educational purposes or as a starting point for more complex token applications.

## **Description**
The MyToken contract allows users to interact with a custom token named "Samita" with the abbreviation "Sam." Users can mint new tokens to increase the total supply and burn tokens to decrease the total supply. The contract includes checks to ensure that tokens can only be minted to valid addresses and that tokens can only be burned if the address holds a sufficient balance.

## **Challenges**
Throughout the course, you will encounter various challenges designed to test your understanding of blockchain concepts and smart contract development. These challenges aim to provide hands-on experience in building decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum platform. You can find the challenges in the Challenges directory.

## **Last Assignment**
The last assignment in the Metacrafter course focuses on building a token using smart contracts on Ethereum. This assignment serves as a culmination of your learning journey, where you will apply the concepts and techniques covered in the course.
